## Projects Highlight

Here's a glimpse into some of the key projects featured on my portfolio:

### AI-Based Blend Optimization Tool

* Works on a constraint module based on optimization, getting top 10 candidates based on given parameters.
* Generates top 3 best blends based on attributes and cost function.
* Applied AI-driven optimization to balance cost and property constraints for chemical blends, significantly reducing manual effort and enabling scalable formulation.
* **Repository:** [https://github.com/Ajay-Varsan/AI-Driven-Catalyst-Blend-Optimizer.git](https://github.com/Ajay-Varsan/AI-Driven-Catalyst-Blend-Optimizer.git)

### AI-Powered Search Optimization for SharePoint

* Developed an AI-powered search enhancement to transform SharePoint efficiency.
* Combines context-aware relevance with precise page-level results and contextual snippets for faster navigation.
* Proposed tech stack includes Apache Tika/FSCrawler for document parsing, Elasticsearch for search indexing, and Sentence Transformers (Hugging Face) for AI ranking models.

### AI Music Recommendation and Cataloging System

* Creates a playlist based on user preference.
* Recommends top songs based on public ratings.
* Stores and recommends albums.

### Traffic Monitoring and Women Safety Enhancement

* Automates Traffic Signals through AI based on vehicle density.
* Alerts the nearest police station during emergency conditions.
* Recommends pink cabs on women safety cabs to travel safely.
* **Repository:** [https://github.com/Selak007/TraffiqueCheck.git](https://github.com/Selak007/TraffiqueCheck.git)

### Counterfeit Currency Detection System

* Developed a system leveraging image processing and machine learning for counterfeit currency detection.
* Utilized handcrafted features like Edge Detection (Canny/Sobel), LBP, GLCM, Color Histograms, and HOG.
* Employed a Custom Random Forest Classifier, robust for high-dimensional, heterogeneous image features.
* Trained and validated the model using an augmented dataset of 50 genuine and 50 counterfeit 500-rupee notes.
* Achieved high accuracy on both training and test datasets, showing strong classification ability.
